In this project, we are working with two json folders, and we are expected to derive two csv files in the end as the output. 
The files are kept in two folders, "cards" and "users" contains json folders of numerous length. 

The project is expected to read the folders and load the multiple json files into python. 
Also the json file type will then be converted into a python dictionary. 

The python dictionaries from the two folders will then be saved as cards.csv and users.csv using the csv.writer module. 

This shows how the project will flow. 


json files in folder -----> open the folder ----> load it into python ---> conver the json datatype into a python dictionary --> save as a list of dictionaries ----> use csv.writer to write into a csv file ----> save as "cards.csv" and "users.csv"
